        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="highlight">Service providers:</span>
            We may share information with trusted third-party service providers who help us host the
            database, provide analytics, or maintain the App. They are required to protect your data and
            use it only for the services they provide to us.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="highlight">Legal requirements:</span>
            We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid legal
            requests by public authorities (e.g., court or government agency).
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information
        against unauthorized access, loss, misuse or alteration. These measures may include
        secure connections, authentication, and restricted access to databases.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage
        is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its
        absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We retain personal and health data for as long as it is necessary to provide the services
        within the App, to comply with legal obligations, or as required by healthcare providers’
        professional practices. Data may be anonymized or deleted when it is no longer needed.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        PregyApp is intended to be used by healthcare professionals and adult patients.
        It is not directed at children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have
        unintentionally collected personal information from a child under 13, we will
        take steps to delete such information as soon as possible.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
